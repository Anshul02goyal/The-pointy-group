Backend Project: Order Management System

This project implements a comprehensive backend for an Order Management System, showcasing various functionalities such as user authentication, product and order management, and automated cron jobs for stock monitoring and order reminders.

Brief Explanation

I approached the task systematically, ensuring each feature was built with efficiency, scalability, and security in mind. Below is a breakdown of how I completed the task:

1. Setting Up the Environment

Used Node.js and Express for building the backend application.

Configured the environment using dotenv for secure management of sensitive data like database credentials, email credentials, and JWT secrets.

Established a connection to MongoDB using mongoose, ensuring a reliable database connection.

2. User Authentication

Implemented user registration and login using hashed passwords (bcrypt) for secure storage.

Utilized JWT for token-based authentication, enabling stateless user sessions.

Added a logout mechanism to blacklist tokens, preventing unauthorized reuse.

3. Modular Architecture

Designed a modular architecture with separate folders for routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

Created reusable middlewares, such as authMiddleware, to protect routes and ensure only authorized users can access certain endpoints.

4. CRUD Operations

Built endpoints for managing users, products, and orders, adhering to RESTful principles.

Enabled soft deletion for products, ensuring data integrity while allowing easy recovery if needed.

Incorporated pagination for fetching products and orders, enhancing performance for large datasets.

5. Automated Cron Jobs

Implemented stock monitoring to alert admins via email when product stock is low.

Set up order fulfillment reminders to notify users of pending orders older than 24 hours.

Used node-cron and nodemailer to schedule and send automated emails.

6. Error Handling and Validation

Implemented robust error handling at both the application and database levels.

Added validation rules in Mongoose schemas to ensure data integrity and meaningful error messages.

7. Testing and Deployment

Tested endpoints using tools like Postman to verify functionality.

Prepared the application for deployment by ensuring environment variables are configurable and the code is well-documented.
